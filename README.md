vertx api demo

In the krydemo/target directory you will find:
  krydemo-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar	
  krydemo-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
which can be run using:
  java -jar krydemo-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar
 
 However I did not have time to make the paths relative so if you edit 
   krydemo/src/main/java/com/krydemo/krydemo/MyFirstVerticle.java
 to suite your directory it should run.
 
 Small sample database files can be found in 
  krydemo/src/main/resources/assets/
  
 My apologies for the inconvinience of it not running out of the box.
